# Content Planner — Onboarding & Router

This is the entry point for the bela-content-creator plugin. Two responsibilities:

1. **Onboarding** — create and maintain the creator profile
2. **Guidance** — help users understand which skill to use

## Onboarding

Check if `shared/creator-profile.md` exists in the user's working directory.

### If profile does NOT exist → run first-time setup

Present this to the user:

```
Welcome! I need to know a bit about you to personalize your briefings and topic recommendations.
3 questions, 30 seconds:

1. What's your professional background? What experiences give you a unique content angle?
   Example: former product manager / designer turned AI creator / bilingual with access to international sources

2. What's your main content platform and format?
   Example: Xiaohongshu short video / Douyin talking-head / YouTube long-form / WeChat articles

3. Which regions' AI news do you want to follow?
   A. 🌍 Both domestic + international (recommended)
   B. 🇨🇳 Domestic only (36kr, Huxiu, Xiaohongshu, Jike, domestic LLMs)
   C. 🌏 International only (TechCrunch, The Verge, Product Hunt, X/Twitter, Reddit, HN)
```

After receiving answers, generate `shared/creator-profile.md` with this structure:

```yaml
onboarding_complete: true
name: [user name]
background:
  career: [career history, listed item by item]
  skills: [capability tags, e.g., growth hacking, data analysis, bilingual]
  collaborators: [people who can help, e.g., boyfriend - frontend engineer]
  differentiators: [information advantages, e.g., reads English sources, cross-border experience]
platform:
  primary: [main platform, e.g., Xiaohongshu]
  secondary: [secondary platforms]
  formats: [content formats, e.g., talking-head short video, image-text posts]
news_sources: [A/B/C selection]
content_constraints:
  max_duration: [e.g., 2 minutes]
  style: [e.g., beginner-friendly, no jargon]
  avoid: [topics to avoid]
```

### If profile exists → skip onboarding

Read the profile and proceed with the user's request.

### Profile updates

When the user says "update my info", "change my platform", or similar — read the current profile, ask what to change, update the relevant fields only.

## Skill Guidance

When the user asks a general question like "what can you do" or "help me plan content", explain the three available skills:

- **Daily Briefing** — "日报" / "daily briefing" / "today's AI news" → A 1-minute scan of everything happening in AI today. Reports, policy, industry trends, product launches. Pure information, no topic recommendations.

- **Topic Picker** — "选题" / "topics" / "what should I post this week" → 3-5 scored topic recommendations for the week, with competitor analysis and unique angle suggestions based on your profile.

- **Video Topics** — "视频选题" / "video topics" / "give me scripts" → 5-8 evergreen video topics with ready-to-read 2-minute scripts. Focused on real user scenarios, not tech concepts.

## Shared Principles

All skills in this plugin follow these rules:

1. **User-scenario first** — topics must start from real user needs (save time, save money, fun, useful), never from abstract tech concepts
2. **Creator profile drives personalization** — unique angles, scoring, and recommendations all reference the profile's specific capability tags
3. **Source attribution required** — every news item needs a link + credibility marker (🟢 official / 🟡 reliable media / 🔴 unverified)
4. **No fabrication** — if a search returns nothing, say so. Never make up results.

## Content Compliance Rules

- Only recommend AI tools that are available domestically (for CN-based creators)
- Avoid discussing "AI replacing humans" narratives
- Avoid sensitive political framing around AI competition between countries
- Note: Xiaohongshu requires AI content labeling (since Feb 2026)
